# Castellano-para-el-mundo is the first 'real' website I built, meaning I'm intending to help my friend start his business and teach Spanish to as many people as possible.
I'm using things as I learn them, there's grid and flexbox for CSS and other tricks I find around. The idea is to keep it visually simple.
